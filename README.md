# Ensemble-Weather-Forecasting

This is a regression model that combines predictions from a linear regression model, ARIMA regression mode, and LSTM recurrent neural network 
to predict the temperature as well as a 95% prediction interval n days into the future.

# Prerequisites
python 3\\
numpy. 
pandas. 
matplotlib. 
scipy. 
sklearn. 
tensorflow. 
statsmodels. 

# Running the code
To run the code, choose the days_ahead parameter in the `main.py` file (which is found in the `src` folder) which represents how many days into the future
the model will predict and then run ```python3 main.py``` to train the models and make the predictions.
